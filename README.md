## About the data

Overview from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e10).


The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Loan Approval Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.


## Evalutation 

Submissions on kaggle competition are evaluated using area under the ROC curve.


## Aims 

I aim to get atleast 0.95 evaluation metric - relating to top 1000 submissions.
